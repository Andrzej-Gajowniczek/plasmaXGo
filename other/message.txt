Hello!
I'm Andy, and this is the GoWithAndy episode.
I'm a newbie in Go, but I have a strong affinity for it.
I've never encountered such an easy-to-understand programming language before, so I've made the decision to learn it.
I code every day and feel quite comfortable with the syntax.
One day, I envisioned myself as a programmer.
I don't believe it's impossible; however, I acknowledge that the journey to becoming a professional might be challenging.
My aspiration is to connect with experienced professionals, learn from them, and eventually become one of them.
Diving into every library can be overwhelming and demanding, particularly while attempting to memorize all that information.
Creating a roadmap with essential libraries and enhancing algorithms is my strategy for constructing not only functional but also robust code.
In conclusion, I find myself at the beginning of a long and captivating adventure. Perhaps someday, I will proudly stand among you as a professional programmer, developer, and architect.
This journey is a road back home, and I'm fully prepared for the voyage with Go.
If you find yourself in a similar situation, join me on this journey called GoWithAndy !!!
Cheers!
Goodbye!
