Hi !
I'm Andy and this is GoWithAndy episode.
I'm newbe in Go but I like it very much.
I've never seen before such easy to understand programming language so I decided to learn it.
I program everyday and feel dquit comfortable with the syntax.
One day I've imagine I could be a programmer.
I don't think it isn't possible but it is tought to begin to be a proffesional.
I would like to meet professionals to grow with them and finaly to become one of them.
Studding every library is a bit overhelming and hard to go through at the same time memorising all that stuff.
I need to make a roadmap with must to have libraries and improve algoritmics to build not only working but also reliable code.
Finally I think I'm on a start of long fascinating adventure and maybe someday I become one of you proffessiona programmers, developers and architects.
This is a long way home, so I'm ready for Go.
If you are in similar situation go with me, GoWithAndy !!!
Cheers !!!
Bye !
