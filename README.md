# plasmaXGo
Introduction:
Welcome to my captivating Go code experiment! To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised when I first witnessed the final result. I couldn't wait to share it with you.

In this endeavor, I've taken the fascinating world of Go programming to create an extraordinary experience right on your terminal screen. It all begins with a seemingly simple idea but evolves into something truly remarkable.I was impressed by retro computers like: MSX, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad, C64, C+4 and all Atari 8bit familly. The demo scene makes hard to believing effects on very limited hardware. There is no such limitation nowadays, so I choose Linux console as a battlefield because of its simplicyty taken back since '60/70 from PDP-10 like Unix Mainframe Computers.

As I delved deeper, I harnessed the power of Go and skillfully embedded external data, resulting in a unique and immersive journey. The magic truly happens when I introduce the 'termbox-go' library, allowing me to take full control of the terminal environment, including its size and user interactions. But the most impresive is how you can easily maipulate of charsets and colors.

Description:
The heart of this project lies in the mesmerizing plasma effect. By artfully manipulating sine and cosine functions, I've brought a dynamic and ever-evolving visual mathematic masterpiece to life. Trust me, when I first saw it in action, I was taken aback by its mesmerizing beauty.
But that's not all! I've also incorporated a text display feature that adds a layer of sophistication. I meticulously load and format text from an embedded file, expertly rendering each character as an 8x8 block. As the text gracefully scrolls upward, it seamlessly blends with the captivating plasma backdrop.
To ensure your viewing pleasure, I've even fine-tuned the frame rate, resulting in an incredibly smooth animation that's easy on the eyes. Keep in mind that console doesnâ€™t have vsync control over the app running on it.
If you're as curious as I was when I started this project, I invite you to explore and enjoy the mesmerizing world of code artistry. I promise you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you discover. So, let's embark on this delightful journey together!
Would you mind it is happening on Linux console ? ;)

Conclusion:
What for is it? 4me mostly for fun&learn. For the others it can be inspiring or maybe you want to reuse the piece code I've share with no restrictions?
Such type of  moving colorful console-block-graphics can be attractive for users more than green text on black screen ;)
Go compiled executable have all dependencies included what is a big advantage to run this on new built machine. 
This kind of app can be easily shared through the many vms by ansible as single file executable and
can be used as a false shell in /etc/passwd to inform user the account has been blocked and what steps are to unlock.

Thank You for your time and please remember:

I strongly encourage you to use termbox-go for creating command-line tools because colors can also be information or indication of state and life becomes easier :D
